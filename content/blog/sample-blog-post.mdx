# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js and MDX

Creating a portfolio website that showcases your work effectively is crucial for any developer. In this post, I'll walk you through how I built my portfolio using Next.js and MDX.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides excellent developer experience with features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for better SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for optimal performance
- **Built-in routing** with the app directory
- **Image optimization** out of the box

## MDX for Content Management

MDX allows you to write JSX in your Markdown files, giving you the power of React components within your content. This is perfect for:

- Interactive code examples
- Custom components within blog posts
- Rich media integration

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Content Loading
The portfolio automatically scans for MDX files and generates pages dynamically.

### 2. Responsive Design
Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first approach.

### 3. Dark Mode Support
Integrated theme switching with next-themes.

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio with Next.js and MDX provides a great balance of performance, developer experience, and content flexibility. The combination allows for both technical blog posts and project showcases in a unified system.

*Happy coding!*
